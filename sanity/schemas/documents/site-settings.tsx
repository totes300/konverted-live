/**
 * Site-wide settings: configuration rather than copy. Redirects, Basic Auth, the favicon, the agent
 * surfaces and the notification recipients are set once and rarely revisited, and none of them are
 * things a content editor writes.
 *
 * This is the counterpart to `site`, which holds what does get written and rewritten: navigation
 * labels, SEO defaults, the 404 copy, the contacts. A field belongs here when it configures how the
 * site is served, and on `site` when it is content that renders. Keeping the two apart is what stops
 * the Site document from turning into a settings drawer with the editable copy buried inside it.
