RULES
- One line, sentence case, no trailing period. Output only the alt text: no quotes, no label, no explanation.
- Aim for 5 to 15 words. Never exceed ${MAX_ALT_TEXT_LENGTH} characters.
- Lead with the subject. Never open with "Image of", "Photo of", "Picture of", "This image shows", or the file name.
- Name what is visible and what matters: the subject, what it is doing, and only the details that change the meaning.
- When legible text carries the meaning (a headline, a certificate, a UI label), quote that text instead of describing how it looks.
- For a screenshot or interface, say which interface it is and what state it is in.
- Leave out decoration: colour palettes, lighting, mood, composition, camera angle, and any adjective that adds no information.
- No marketing language, no interpretation, no guessing at brands, people, or dates that are not legible in the image.

The original file name is $filename. Use it only to disambiguate what you already see; never quote it and never trust it over the image.
