/**
 * Everything the form submits, minus the spam-prevention fields (those belong to `detectSpam`).
 * Email is shape only: whether the address exists is Resend's problem, not the schema's.
 *
 * One field of every control type on purpose: this form is the worked example the form components
 * point back to. The optionality idioms differ by control (see docs/features/forms.md): a field a
 * blank parse passes is optional (`phone`, `startDate`), an optional radio group needs
 * `.or(z.literal(""))` because nothing selected reads as `""`, and a checkbox group is an array,
 * required through `.min(1)`.
