# llms.txt and AI agents

The site serves an [`/llms.txt`](https://llmstxt.org) file: a concise, curated Markdown map of the site that helps large language models use it at inference time (when a context window cannot hold the whole site). The file lives in Sanity, so editors own it, and it can be drafted in one click with Sanity AI (Agent Actions) from the site's own content.

- **Edit it:** Studio, **Settings** document, **Agents** tab.
- **Generate it:** the **Generate** button in the **llms.txt** object (Sanity AI), backed by the `/api/agents/llms-txt` endpoint.
- **Serve it:** published content is served at `/llms.txt` as `text/plain`, rendered on demand.

For the reusable pattern behind the Generate button (how to add more AI-generated fields), see [Agent Actions (Sanity AI generation)](../sanity/agent-actions.md).

## How it works

```
Studio (Settings -> Agents)             Astro (server)
┌───────────────────────────┐           ┌──────────────────────────────┐
│ llms.txt field            │  POST     │ /api/agents/llms-txt         │
│  └ "Generate" button ─────┼──────────▶│  1. read indexable pages     │
│                           │           │     (edit token, drafts)     │
│  (review the draft,       │◀──────────┤  2. client.agent.action      │
│   then Publish)           │  { text } │       .prompt() -> markdown  │
└───────────┬───────────────┘           └──────────────────────────────┘
            │ publish
            ▼
   published llms.content    ──────────▶  GET /llms.txt (text/plain)
```

1. An editor opens **Settings -> Agents** and clicks **Generate**.
2. `LlmsTxtInput` POSTs to `/api/agents/llms-txt`.
3. The endpoint reads the site's indexable pages and articles, then asks **Sanity Agent Actions** (`client.agent.action.prompt`) to draft a spec-compliant llms.txt.
4. The draft is written into the field. Nothing is served yet: the editor reviews and edits the Markdown like any other field.
5. On **Publish**, `/llms.txt` serves the published value.

The split is deliberate. Generation reads current content (drafts overlaid) so it reflects work in progress, while serving only ever returns the published field, so a draft is never exposed at `/llms.txt`.

## Editing in the Studio

**Settings -> Agents** is a tab that holds one object per AI surface, so it stays scalable (more such as `agents.txt` or MCP can be added beside it later). Today it has one object, `llms` (for llms.txt), with three fields:

| Field                                | Type    | Purpose                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Serve /llms.txt** (`enabled`)      | boolean | Gates serving. On by default. Turn it off to return 404 at `/llms.txt` without deleting the content.                                                          |
| **Generation guidance** (`guidance`) | text    | Optional steer for the AI: tone, audience, what to emphasize or leave out. Persisted, so it is reused on every Generate even if the button does not pass one. |
| **Content** (`content`)              | text    | The Markdown served at `/llms.txt`. Holds the **Generate** button (custom input `LlmsTxtInput`).                                                              |

You can also write or paste the file by hand. The button is a convenience, not a requirement.

Clicking **Generate** when the field already has content opens a Sanity confirmation dialog before replacing it (no native browser prompt). Success and failure surface as Sanity toasts.

## Generating with Sanity AI

The **Generate** button calls `/api/agents/llms-txt` (`src/pages/api/agents/llms-txt.ts`), which:

1. **Reads the inventory.** `LlmsTxtInventoryQuery` (`src/features/agents/query.ts`) returns the site name, the site SEO description (used as the summary), the stored generation guidance, and every indexable page and article. "Indexable" uses the same rules as the sitemap: has a URI, `seoMetadata.noIndex != true`, and `passwordProtected != true`. The fetch runs with an edit token under the `drafts` perspective, so unpublished edits are reflected.
2. **Builds grounded inputs.** Each entry becomes `{ type, title, url, description, publishedAt, categories }` with an absolute URL built from `PUBLIC_SITE_URL`. URLs are constructed in code, never by the model, so they cannot be hallucinated. Pages that need no title (the homepage and other index/singleton pages) get a route-derived label (`/` becomes `Index`, `/works` becomes `Works`) instead of "Untitled", and entries are de-duplicated by URL, so an alternate route that resolves to an already-listed page is dropped rather than listed twice.
3. **Prompts the model.** `client.agent.action.prompt()` runs with an instruction that encodes the llmstxt.org structure and rules, plus the inventory as a constant parameter. The action returns the Markdown string; the endpoint strips any stray code fence and returns `{ text }`.
4. The input writes the result with `onChange(set(text))`.

### Conventions the output follows

The instruction mirrors the [llmstxt.org specification](https://llmstxt.org) (Jeremy Howard, September 2024):

- A single `# H1` with the site name. This is the only required section.
- A `>` blockquote summary carrying the key context for the rest of the file.
- A non-heading detail block with four things in order: how to use the index, one sentence telling agents every listed page is also available as token-light Markdown via content negotiation (`Accept: text/markdown` on the same URL, see [Agent Markdown](./agent-markdown.md)), why legal pages are listed when there are any, and a **"When to use this site:"** note naming the concrete jobs the site is the right source for. That last note is the one an agent reads when deciding whether to reach for you at all, so it must name jobs rather than restate marketing copy.
- One or more `## H2` sections, each a list of `- [name](url): note` links. Default sections are **Pages** and **Articles**. Legal and policy pages stay in the main section: agents consult them before recommending anything.
- A **`## Developer resources`** section listing `/openapi.json`, `/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt`. This one is not written by the model: `insertDeveloperResourcesSection` (`src/features/agents/llms-txt-resources.ts`) appends it in code after generation, before any `## Optional` section, so the machine endpoints are always present with exact URLs.
- An optional final `## Optional` section for links that can be skipped when a shorter context is needed, omitted entirely when nothing qualifies.
- Only the URLs from the inventory, each used once, copied verbatim.
- An index, not a copy: each link gets at most one descriptive sentence and page bodies are never reproduced (that is what the per-page Markdown is for). Concise language, no jargon, no marketing fluff.

Because it is a draft in a normal field, you stay in control: edit anything, reorder sections, move links under `## Optional`, then publish.

### Prerequisites

- **Sanity AI / Agent Actions** must be available on the project (a paid capability that consumes AI credits). If it is not enabled, Generate returns the error Sanity reports; you can still author the field by hand.
- **`SANITY_API_EDIT_TOKEN`** must be set (it already powers the SEO screenshot and contact form endpoints). The endpoint uses it server-side; no new environment variable is introduced.
- At least one indexable page must exist, otherwise the endpoint returns `422` with a clear message.

## Serving `/llms.txt`

`src/pages/llms.txt.ts` is an Astro endpoint (the file name carries the `.txt` extension, like `robots.txt.ts` and `sitemap.xml.ts`):

- Reads the published `llms.enabled` and `llms.content` via `LlmsTxtServeQuery` through `loadQuery` (published perspective; a serve of this endpoint never carries draft content).
- Returns **404** when serving is disabled (`enabled === false`) or the content is empty.
- Otherwise returns the Markdown as `text/plain; charset=utf-8`.
- **Freshness.** The file renders on demand behind a short CDN cache (`s-maxage=3600, stale-while-revalidate`), so a published change is live once the cache window rolls over (see [Revalidation and Caching](../sanity/revalidation-and-caching.md)).

### Basic Auth and routing

`/llms.txt` contains a dot, so the middleware never runs Basic Auth on it (dotted paths are excluded). It behaves exactly like `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`: reachable even when the site is fully gated. If you want it private, turn **Serve /llms.txt** off.

The dedicated `src/pages/llms.txt.ts` route takes precedence over the `src/pages/[...uri].astro` catch-all, the same way the sitemap and robots routes do.

## Manual verification

After deploying (or in local dev with Sanity AI enabled):

1. **Studio:** open **Settings -> Agents**, click **Generate**, confirm a draft appears that starts with `# <site name>` and lists your pages with absolute URLs.
2. **Publish** the Settings document.
3. **Serve:** `curl -i https://<your-domain>/llms.txt` returns `200` with `content-type: text/plain` and the published Markdown.
4. **Disable:** turn **Serve /llms.txt** off, publish, and confirm `curl -i .../llms.txt` returns `404`.
5. **Freshness:** edit the field, publish, and confirm the served file updates within the CDN cache window.

## How llms.txt and per-page Markdown combine

Two layers, the pattern the [Sanity field guide](https://www.sanity.io/blog/how-to-serve-content-to-agents-a-field-guide) recommends:

- **Discovery, llms.txt.** A concise index that links the regular page URLs, so an agent can see what exists and pick what it needs without loading the site. It is a map, not a copy: page bodies never go here. That is what an `llms-full.txt` would be (deliberately not implemented), and the guide warns it bloats the context window for no benefit.
- **Retrieval, per-page Markdown.** When the agent follows one of those links with `Accept: text/markdown`, the same URL returns a token-light Markdown body instead of HTML (see [Agent Markdown](./agent-markdown.md)). On by default, toggleable per page.

The two need no special wiring: llms.txt links the normal HTML URLs (valid per the core spec) and content negotiation serves Markdown on those same URLs. Because the negotiation is transparent, advertising it is optional; the generation instruction still has the model add one short sentence to the llms.txt details section noting the capability, so agents and tools that read the file but do not negotiate automatically still learn it is there.

## AI crawler policy (robots.txt)

The default stance is **search and citation yes, model training no**. `llms.txt` exists to be read
by assistants, so `robots.txt` must not block the crawlers that do the reading.

The policy lives in [`src/features/agents/ai-crawlers.ts`](../../src/features/agents/ai-crawlers.ts) and is
served by [`src/pages/robots.txt.ts`](../../src/pages/robots.txt.ts). Keeping it in the codebase is
the point: CDNs and hosting platforms increasingly inject managed AI-crawler blocks into
`robots.txt` at the edge, which makes the served policy a property of where the site runs rather
than of the site. Moving hosts, or a vendor revising its managed list, would otherwise change the
policy with no commit and no review.


What each decision costs, since it is not uniform:

| Agent | Rule | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GPTBot` | Block | Training corpus only. `OAI-SearchBot` and `ChatGPT-User` are separate agents and stay allowed, so ChatGPT search can still cite the site. |
| `Google-Extended` | Block | Gemini app and Vertex grounding only. Does **not** affect Google Search or AI Overviews, which follow Googlebot. |
| `Applebot-Extended`, `meta-externalagent`, `Bytespider`, `Amazonbot` | Block | Training corpora, no traffic or attribution back. |
| `ClaudeBot`, `Claude-User`, `Claude-SearchBot` | Allow | Blocking removes the site from Claude's crawl entirely. Direct citation loss. |
| `OAI-SearchBot`, `ChatGPT-User`, `PerplexityBot`, `Perplexity-User` | Allow | Answer engines that fetch a page in order to cite it. |
| `CCBot` | Allow | Common Crawl feeds training corpora **and** the open web graph that independent link analysis reads. Blocking it mostly costs the ability to measure the site's own reach. |

Two details that are easy to get wrong:

- **Named groups do not inherit from `*`.** A crawler obeys only the most specific group matching
  its name and ignores every other group (RFC 9309), so each named group repeats the site's own
  `Disallow` prefixes (`/api/` and the Studio path). Without that, naming an agent to allow
  it would quietly invite it into the paths `*` keeps out.
- **`Content-Signal` is not a crawl rule.** User-agent groups gate the fetch; the signal
  ([contentsignals.org](https://contentsignals.org)) states what may be done with the content
  afterwards, and is an express reservation of rights under Article 4 of EU Directive 2019/790.

**If the host also injects rules, turn that off.** Two sources for one file is how a policy drifts
from what its owner believes it is. Verify the served result with
`curl -s https://<domain>/robots.txt` and confirm no agent appears twice with conflicting rules.

To change the stance, edit the two exported lists. If it ever flips to a hard no for all AI, drop
`llms.txt` as well: maintaining an AI-facing index for crawlers that are all blocked is
maintenance with no upside.

## Future enhancements (not implemented)

These are deliberately out of scope, noted so the choice is explicit:

- **`llms-full.txt`.** A single file expanding every linked page's full content for tools that want the whole corpus in one fetch.
- **`agents.txt`.** A separate capability-declaration file ([agents-txt.com](https://agents-txt.com)) for payment, auth, and MCP endpoints. It is configuration rather than AI-generated content; the **Agents** tab is the natural home if it is added later.
