# Documentation

This folder contains focused documentation for individual features and workflows.

## Start Here

Use this path if you are new to the repository:

1. Read [Deployment](./deployment.md): host-agnostic SSR (pages rendered on demand, embedded Studio, `/api/*`, and middleware on one server); the deploy target is the adapter in `astro.config.mjs`
2. Read [Sanity Setup Overview](./sanity/README.md)
3. Read [Contributor Workflow](./sanity/contributor-workflow.md)
4. Use the task index below to jump to your specific job

## Security and access

- **HTTP Basic Auth**: optional site-wide or per-URL gate: **`BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME`** / **`BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`** in deployment env; **Settings** and per-entry toggles in Sanity. Implemented in **`src/middleware.ts`** (`getSanityBasicAuthState()`). Details: [Basic Authentication](./features/basic-auth.md).

- Add an AI-generated field (Sanity Agent Actions pattern) -> [Agent Actions](./sanity/agent-actions.md)
- Let AI agents drive Chrome or query the Astro docs -> [MCP Servers](./features/mcp-servers.md)
- Add a modal, or open a page as an overlay over another -> [Dialogs and overlay routes](./features/dialogs-and-overlay-routes.md)
