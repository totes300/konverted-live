# Revalidation and Caching

This stack caches rendered routes with **tag-based invalidation**, built on Astro's route caching API (`Astro.cache` / `context.cache`, configured in `astro.config.mjs`). A signed Sanity webhook at `/api/revalidate` invalidates the right tags on publish, so cached pages refresh the moment content changes while normal traffic is served from the cache. The app answers every cache lookup itself (`src/lib/route-cache/`); no CDN in front of it ever holds a copy. Where entries are *stored* is the one host-specific part: on Vercel it is the Runtime Cache, shared by every instance, and anywhere else it is an in-process store. A deploy empties either one.

## The tag model

Tags follow one convention, shared by the pages that set them (`src/lib/cache.ts`) and the webhook that busts them:

| Tag | Example | Set on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Document `_type` | `page`, `article`, `site`, `siteSettings` | Every response rendered from that type |
| `doc:<publishedId>` | `doc:homepage` | The document's own routes |
| The routed `uri` | `/about` | The document's page and its agent Markdown |

Two structural rules make the model work:

- **Every page also carries both site-wide singletons.** The header, footer, and SEO fallbacks come from the Site singleton, and the favicon comes from Settings; all of them render on every page, so each page response is tagged with both `_type`s (`SITE_WIDE_CACHE_TAGS` in `src/lib/cache.ts`). Publishing either singleton therefore invalidates the whole site through one tag.
- **List-like routes carry every contributing type.** `sitemap.xml` is tagged `page`, `legalPage`, `article`, and both site-wide types, so any routed document's publish refreshes it. The blog index adds `article` and `articleCategory` on top of its own document tags, so publishing any post or category refreshes the listing. `llms.txt` carries the site-wide types too (its content lives on `siteSettings`).

Where tags are set: `src/pages/[...uri].astro`, `src/pages/blog/[slug].astro`, and `src/pages/blog/index.astro` (`Astro.cache.set` with `CACHE_TTL` and `docCacheTags(page)` + `SITE_WIDE_CACHE_TAGS`), `src/pages/llms.txt.ts`, `src/pages/sitemap.xml.ts`, `src/pages/favicon.ico.ts`, and `src/pages/api/agent-markdown/[...uri].ts`.

## The provider

`astro.config.mjs` points Astro's cache API at `src/lib/route-cache/provider.ts`. Every lookup is **answered by the app**: rendered responses go into a `RouteCacheStore`, the app reads them back itself, and no response ever carries a header that would let a CDN or any other shared cache downstream hold a copy. That is deliberate. Invalidation is the webhook expiring tags in the store, and a copy sitting in a cache the webhook cannot reach would outlive every publish. The policy is identical on every host; only the store behind it changes.

| Module | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `provider.ts` | The configured entrypoint: wires runtime env (Basic Auth credentials) into the policy |
| `create-provider.ts` | The policy: what may be cached, what is bypassed, gated vs public keying, tag invalidation. It does no background work, so a long-lived server and serverless behave identically; the provider tests are the contract for both |
| `rules.ts` | The bypass predicates and the Basic Auth credential match |
| `entry.ts` | Key normalization, lifetime rule, and (de)serialization for stored entries |
| `store.ts` | The `RouteCacheStore` type (`get` / `set` with ttl+tags / `expireTag`) and the in-memory LRU + tag-index default |
| `vercel-store.ts` | The same three methods against Vercel's Runtime Cache, plus the deploy-purge wiring |
| `deploy-purge.ts` | Store decorator that empties the cache once, on the first request a new deployment serves |

Requests the middleware (`src/middleware.ts`) must handle specially skip the cache entirely:

- **Draft mode** (the `sanity-preview-perspective` cookie): editors always see fresh draft renders, and draft responses are additionally excluded from being stored (`cache.set(false)` in the middleware).
- **Agent Markdown negotiation** (`Accept` mentions markdown): the middleware's rewrite must run; a cached HTML hit would answer first.
- **Unmatched `Authorization` headers** (wrong password, unrelated Bearer token): the middleware decides, and nothing is stored.

Everyone else gets the cached fast path: `X-Astro-Cache: HIT|MISS` on every cacheable response. Only a plain `200` with no `Set-Cookie` and a body under 1&nbsp;MB is stored; bodies travel base64-encoded (`entry.ts`) because `/favicon.ico` is bytes.

### Basic Auth traffic is cached too

Shared caches refuse any request carrying an `Authorization` header (RFC 9111; every CDN applies it), which is one of the reasons the store lives in the app, past that rule. Gated traffic is cached with two safeguards:

- **Separate keyspaces.** Gated entries are stored under a `gated:` key prefix and public entries under `public:`, so a stored gated render can never be read by a request that has not matched the credentials. An unauthenticated request for a protected URL misses the `public:` keyspace, reaches the middleware, and gets its 401, which is never stored.
- **Exact credential match.** A request only counts as gated when its `Authorization` header matches `BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME` / `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` exactly, compared in constant time (`rules.ts`, on the helpers in `src/features/auth/basic-auth.ts`). A browser replays that identical header on every request after the 401, so an entry is only ever handed back to a visitor already through the gate. Note that the key carries no trace of the credentials themselves: rotating `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` does not orphan entries written under the old one, it just means only holders of the new password can reach them. Either way the redeploy that applies the new env var clears them, since a deploy empties the cache.

A hit answers before the middleware runs, so a protection change relies on the same publish-driven invalidation everything else does: turning **Password protect** on publishes that document and busts its tags, and **Protect entire site** lives on Settings, whose tag every page carries.

### Where entries are stored

`provider.ts` picks the store at startup from one flag, `ROUTE_CACHE_VERCEL_RUNTIME` (a boolean, so only `true` or `false`; defaults to `false`):

- **`true`, on Vercel: the Runtime Cache** (`vercel-store.ts`, on `getCache()` from `@vercel/functions`). One cache for the whole project, shared by every function instance, so the webhook's `expireTag` reaches every copy at once. Vercel documents it as **persistent across deployments**, which is what makes it shared rather than what makes it stale: entries are deliberately purged when a new release first serves (see below), so what outlives a deploy is the warm shared store, not the HTML in it. It is also split per environment, so preview/staging never reads production's entries, and per project on Pro and Enterprise plans (on Hobby, all of a team's projects share one cache and one storage budget).
- **`false`, the default: the in-process LRU** (`store.ts`). Per process, so a deployment running several instances has one store each and the webhook only expires tags on the instance that receives it; the others keep their copy until that instance is recycled. A deploy or restart starts empty. This is what dev, `astro preview`, and any non-Vercel host use.

It is an explicit flag rather than a sniff of Vercel's own `VERCEL` variable so that a build behaves the same wherever it runs, and so switching hosts is a config change rather than a code change. It is read at runtime (not inlined at build), which is what keeps `vercel deploy --prebuilt` from baking the local machine's value into the deployment.

Any other shared backend (Redis and friends) plugs into the same three-method `RouteCacheStore` type, and nothing else in the route cache changes.

Two Vercel details worth knowing. Route keys are passed to the Runtime Cache percent-encoded rather than through its default hash, which is only 32 bits wide and would eventually serve one page's HTML under another page's URL. And its limits (2&nbsp;MB per item, 128 tags per item, 256 bytes per tag) sit comfortably above what this app stores: bodies are capped at 1&nbsp;MB before encoding, and a page carries about seven short tags. Entries are evicted least-recently-used when the cache fills, and reads and writes are billed.

Freshness is publish-driven only. Publishing a document expires its tags through the webhook the moment it happens; nothing expires on a timer. `CACHE_TTL` in `src/lib/cache.ts` sets a nominal year-long `maxAge` because the cache API requires one, so in practice a cached page lives until a publish busts it.

### A deploy still empties it

Surviving a deploy is only wanted for the *store*, not for the entries. Rendered HTML is a function of code and content, so a release carrying new markup makes every cached page potentially wrong, and no tag is invalidated by a deploy. Common practice on every platform is that rendered-output caches do not cross a release (Vercel's own CDN cache key includes the deployment URL, and its ISR content is regenerated for a new deployment) while data caches do.

So `deploy-purge.ts` restores that. It wraps the store and, on the first read or write a build performs, compares its own build id against a marker held in the cache. A different value means a new release: purge everything, then record the new id. Reads and writes both wait on it, so a request racing the purge cannot store an entry the purge then deletes.

The build id is `__ROUTE_CACHE_BUILD_ID__`, a compile-time constant that `astro.config.mjs` bakes into the bundle through `vite.define`. Vercel's `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_ID` would have been the obvious source and is the wrong one: the whole system-variable set is gated behind the project's **Enable access to System Environment Variables** checkbox, so with it off the variable is simply absent and the purge would be silently disabled. A baked-in constant cannot be switched off from a dashboard, behaves identically on every host, and tracks the thing that actually invalidates cached HTML, which is the code changing rather than a deployment happening.

The purge covers both layers. `expireTag` clears the app's own entries in the Runtime Cache, and `invalidateByTag` from `@vercel/functions` covers Vercel's CDN and Data cache for the same tag. The first has to succeed; a failure in the second is logged and ignored, because the app stores nothing in either today and it must not keep a release purging on every request.

Three deliberate choices:

- **The purge runs inside the deployment, not at build time**, even though the id is decided at build time. A build-time purge finishes while the previous deployment is still serving, so any page rendered between the purge and the alias flip would survive into the new release. That is the exact staleness being prevented. Running on first request cannot happen too early.
- **The marker carries no tags**, so a purge cannot take it with it and leave every later request purging again.
- **A rebuild of unchanged code still purges**, since the id is per build rather than per commit. Promoting or rolling back to an older deployment purges too, because its baked-in id differs from the marker.

Several instances of one release can each purge once, which is harmless: expiring a tag twice costs nothing, and the second pass only re-renders what the first had re-cached. A purge that fails is retried on the next request rather than remembered, since serving stale markup is the worse outcome.

What survives a deploy, then, is the *warm store shared across instances*, not stale HTML. The in-process store gives neither: it is per-instance, so the webhook only ever reaches the one that receives it and every new instance starts cold regardless.

## The webhook

`/api/revalidate` (`src/pages/api/revalidate.ts`) verifies the request signature with `@sanity/webhook` and `SANITY_REVALIDATE_SECRET`, then invalidates `[_type, doc:<id>, uri]` for the published document.

Create the webhook once per project at [sanity.io/manage](https://www.sanity.io/manage) (API, Webhooks):

- **URL**: `<your-site>/api/revalidate`
- **Trigger on**: create, update, delete
- **Projection**: `{_id, _type, "uri": uri.current}`
- **Secret**: the value of `SANITY_REVALIDATE_SECRET` in your deployment environment

`SANITY_REVALIDATE_SECRET` is optional: skip the webhook entirely and the build still passes. Leave it unset and `/api/revalidate` answers 500. Without it, a published change reaches a cached route only on the next deploy, since that is what empties the cache. The same applies once the secret is set but the webhook is not yet registered in Sanity, so setting up the webhook is the step that makes publishing live without a redeploy.

Note: the webhook expires tags in the app's own store. On Vercel that is one shared cache and the call reaches every instance; on the in-process store it only reaches the instance that receives it. See **Where entries are stored** above.

## Clearing the whole cache

Publishing is the normal way to refresh content, and a deploy empties the cache on its own. `/api/cache-purge` is the escape hatch for the case neither covers: the cache itself looks wrong and you want everything gone without shipping a release.

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $SANITY_REVALIDATE_SECRET" https://<site>/api/cache-purge
```

It reuses `SANITY_REVALIDATE_SECRET` rather than introducing a second one. Both endpoints do exactly one thing, bust cache, so sharing the secret grants no capability its holder does not already have: anyone with it can already forge a webhook signature and purge by tag. If you ever want them separated, the endpoint reads one env var and nothing else depends on that choice.

Mechanically it is not a special path through the store. Every stored entry carries `ROUTE_CACHE_ALL_TAG` (`route-cache:all`) alongside its document tags, so purging is the same `expireTag` call every publish makes, just with a tag that matches everything. Gated and public entries go together.

Its reach follows the store. On Vercel one call clears the whole environment. On the in-process store it clears **the instance that receives the request**, like the webhook does, so a scaled-out deployment needs one call per instance. Either way a redeploy also empties everything, which remains the guaranteed reset if the endpoint itself is the thing misbehaving.

## Where caching also exists

- **Middleware state reads.** The Basic Auth and agent-Markdown eligibility reads query the **live** Sanity API behind a 5-minute per-instance stale-while-revalidate hot cache with in-flight dedupe (`src/features/auth/sanity-basic-auth-proxy.ts`, `src/features/agents/markdown-proxy-state.ts`). Five minutes is the propagation ceiling for those toggles; see [Basic Auth](../features/basic-auth.md).
- **HTTP cache headers.** The `llms.txt` and `sitemap.xml` responses carry `s-maxage=3600, stale-while-revalidate=86400` for CDN caching; the agent-Markdown serve route sends `max-age=0, must-revalidate` plus `Vary: Accept` so shared caches never serve the wrong representation.
- **Sanity API CDN is off in production.** `astro.config.mjs` configures the base client with `useCdn: false` and `src/sanity/lib/client.ts` flips it on in development only (cheap reads while iterating), so deployed cache misses render from fresh, authenticated reads. Draft-mode reads and the preview-url handshake pin `useCdn: false` in every environment.

## Redirects Are Build-Time

Redirects are fetched in `astro.config.mjs` (`fetchRedirects()`) and baked into the build.

Implications:

- Updating redirects in Sanity does not hot-update a running server
- A rebuild/redeploy is required for redirect changes to apply. The Settings document's **Redirects** field renders a **Redeploy site** button (`sanity/inputs/redeploy-input.tsx`); it is a placeholder that logs a warning and shows a toast until you attach your project's rebuild trigger in `handleRedeploy` (a deploy hook, a GitHub `workflow_dispatch`, a box-local script). See [Deployment](../deployment.md).
